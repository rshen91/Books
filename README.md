### booktracker is using [elasticsearch.js](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/15.x/api-reference.html) API version 6.3
*I'm creating a book tracker using Elasticsearch and React (version 16.4.2). The books are generated by a CSV file from Excel that is being ingested via Logstash and into a local cluster.*
*I plan to migrate to Elastic Cloud in later stages.* 

*If you have any curiosity on the elasticsearch set up feel free to contact me and I am more than happy to discuss my implementation.*
